<h2>Privacy Policy for Ironbeast</h2>
<p>Ironbeast is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle the information related to your use of the app.</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>
<p>All workout logs, progress, and personal details you enter into Ironbeast are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not collect or store this information on our own servers or cloud services.</p>

<h3>Automatically Collected Data</h3>
<p>To help maintain reliability and improve performance, Ironbeast may automatically collect certain technical information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crash Reports and Diagnostics</strong>: If the app encounters an error, anonymized technical data (such as device model, operating system version, app version, and error logs) may be sent securely to our crash reporting provider. This information is used only to identify and fix bugs and is never linked to your workout logs or personal details.</li>
  <li><strong>App Updates</strong>: Ironbeast uses Expo’s update service to deliver the latest app versions. This may transmit non-personal device and app information (such as app version and installation ID) to Expo’s servers to check for updates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>No Data Sharing</h3>
<p>Ironbeast does not sell or share your personal workout data with third parties. The only external services involved are for crash reporting and app updates, which are required to maintain and improve the app.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Your workout and personal data remain on your device. All communications with third-party services (such as Expo and crash analytics providers) are encrypted in transit. Please ensure your device is secure to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>Data Deletion</h3>
<p>Ironbeast does not maintain user accounts or external databases. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored workout and personal data is deleted. Crash and diagnostic reports are automatically removed by our providers after their retention period.</p>

<h3>Updates to This Policy</h3>
<p>We may update this privacy policy as needed. Any changes will be included in future app updates.</p>

<p>If you have questions, issues, or suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/jaroslawgabara/ironbeast/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
